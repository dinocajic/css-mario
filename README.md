Had to create a pure CSS Web-Programming Class Project. Here it is.

HTML used:
- divs for styling
- form for form field on the box (not necessary but done to prove it can be done)

Images used:
- Super Mario gif
- Background Images for rotating cube and internal cube (png and gif)
- bushes (png)
- hills (png)
- clouds (png)

CSS used:
- Pretty much everything that you see has CSS
- The pipe is pure CSS styling on divs
- The 3d objects and animations are all CSS properties
